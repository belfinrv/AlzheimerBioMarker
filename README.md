## Abstract
This study evaluates the spatial coupling between tau and neurodegeneration (atrophy) and its relation to Aβ positivity in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Data from 409 participants were included (95 cognitively normal controls, 158 Aβ positive (Aβ+) MCI, and 156 Aβ negative (Aβ-) MCI). Florbetapir PET, Flortaucipir PET, and structural MRI were used as biomarkers. Fewer than 25% of the ROIs showed heightened coupling between tau and atrophy in Aβ+ MCI, with significant mediation in the right rostral middle frontal and right paracentral gyri.

## Methods
Data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) included 314 MCI and 95 CN participants. Florbetapir and flortaucipir PET, along with structural MRI, were analyzed using FreeSurfer v7.1.1. Individual covariance networks were reconstructed and modeled as multilayer networks to study interactions between tau and atrophy.

## Results
- **Demographics:** No significant differences in sex or education between Aβ+ and Aβ- groups; differences in age and CDR-SB scores were noted.
- **Tau Load & Atrophy:** Higher tau load and atrophy levels in Aβ+ participants.
- **Coupling:** Greater coupling in Aβ+ group in specific brain regions, with right hemisphere dominance.
- **Mediation:** Coupling in right rostral middle frontal and paracentral gyri mediated the association between Aβ burden and cognition.

## Discussion
The study shows stronger coupling between tau and atrophy in Aβ+ MCI individuals. This coupling was significant in fewer than 25% of ROIs but mediated important associations between Aβ burden and cognitive dysfunction, especially in specific frontal and paracentral regions.

## Summary
Significant coupling between tau and atrophy was observed in a minority of ROIs, with crucial mediation in the right rostral middle frontal and paracentral regions, underscoring their role in cognitive impairment in AD.
